# Founder's Journey

## Overview
Gothic point-and-click adventure game. TypeScript + Vite + Vercel.

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — development server
- `npm run build` — production build

## Self-Maintenance Rules
- When a change introduces or alters a structural convention
  (e.g. folder layout, asset pipeline, naming scheme, build workflow),
  add or update a rule in this file so future sessions follow it
  without being told.
- When a change removes a convention (e.g. a folder is deleted,
  a workflow is replaced), remove the corresponding rule from this
  file so it doesn't mislead future sessions.
- Rules should be concise, actionable, and describe *what to do*
  — not history. If a rule no longer matches the codebase, delete it.
- This file is the single source of truth for project-specific
  patterns. Read it at the start of every task; update it whenever
  the patterns change.

## Asset Management
[Your existing asset rules about src/assets/used/
and src/assets/game/ go here]

## Gotchas
- CRLF warnings from Git are normal on Windows, ignore them

## Architecture Decisions
[Grows organically as you build]
